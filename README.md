Face Recognition using Computer Vision Toolbox Matlab

About
===========
The recognition depends on the eginefaces algorithms. I have implemented it using matlab. This program show the very basic image recognition principle. I will use fisherfaces shortly to imporve the recognition.

Uses
===========
Run the finalreco.m file using matlab version latter than 2012a.
Firt store the training images into the tranningImages/ folder. 
Then run train.m file to train these images stored in trainningImages/ folder.
Edit the train.m file to include the name of the persons face.
Then after completion of training phase run finalreco.m to see the face recognition at work.
